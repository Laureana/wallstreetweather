# Wall Street Weather

A free, public dashboard recording market-traded entities' metrics, cryptographically signed and broadcast by economic agents in real-time.

## What it is

- **Public good** — no accounts, no paywall, no capture
- **Real-time** — overnight updates like SOFR, not quarterly dumps
- **Cryptographically signed** — entities sign their own data, verifiable by anyone
- **Minimal** — integers and booleans, not narratives

## Why
